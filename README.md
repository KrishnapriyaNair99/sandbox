About Linux :

Linux is POSIX compliant of UNIX operating system. This is developed by Linus Torvalds in the year 1991
Linux is a name which broadly denotes a family of free and open-source software operating systems (OS) built around the Linux kernel.
Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution for both desktop and server use.
The defining component of a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991.
 
	Basic Features of Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Portable 

 Portability means software can works on different types of hardware in same way. 
Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation on any kind of hardware platform.

2. Open Source 

 Linux source code is freely available and it is community based development project.
 Multiple teams work in collaboration to enhance the capability of Linux operating system and it is continuously evolving.

3. Multi-User 

 Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access system resources like memory/ ram/ application programs at same time.

4. Multiprogramming 

 Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple applications can run at same time.

5. Hierarchical File System 

Linux provides a standard file structure in which system files/ user files are arranged.

6. Shell
